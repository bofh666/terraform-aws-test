# My Terraform AWS IaaC test

It creates (and successfully destroys :) PostgreSQL RDS instance, single EC2 instance and ELB in single region with possibility to scale slightly within Free Tier.

As it's just a test, I didn't break it into or use any available modules, did't use provisioning and tried to KISS (readable and secure though) intentionally.
